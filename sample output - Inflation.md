# Disruptive Inflation

## Description in brief
* Inflation risks could arise from an extended period of over-accomodative monetary and fiscal policy, against a backdrop of a weak economy.the backdrop of a weak economy could be due to a recession or a slow recovery from a recession.of eroding spare capacity and rising demand for credit.
* Another channel could be rising fiscal dominance, in which policymakers keep rates low to keep debt loads sustainable despite rising Inflation.
* These factors contribute to the un-anchoring of inflation expectations.
* Supply-side shocks such as oil price shock or supply chain disruption on the back of accelerating de-globalization could also contribute to disruptive inflation also add to risks
* A second Trump presidency could spark a tariff war with China, broadly hurting sentiment, depressing global trade and raising costs around the world.

# Signposts:
* Closing output gap, rising credit demand, leading growth indicators, inflation data
* Compromised central bank independence and shifts in inflation targets
* Signs of faster de-globalisation and supply chain relocation
* US elections, annoucements of tariffs/other proposed policies by candidates

# Detailed narrative:
Inflation risks emerge from an extended period of overly accomodative monetary and fiscal policies, set against a backdrop of eroding spare capacity and rising demand for credit. As central banks and governments contribute to inject liquidity into the economy and maintain low interest rates to support growth, the diminishing slack in the economy loads to supward pressure on prices. 
Increased borrowing and spending further fuel demand, straining the supply side of the economy and heightening the risk of inflation as the balance between supply and demand becomes increasingly skewed.

Rising fiscal dominance compounds these inflation risks, as policymakers prioritize keeping interest rates low to manage the sustainablity of high debt levels, even as inflation begins to rise. This approach leads to a dangerous un-anchoring of inflation expectations, as business and consumers start to anticipate higher future inflation and adjust their behavior accordingly. The erosion of confidence in the central bank's ability to control inflation exacerbates the situation, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of risng prices. 

Supply-side shocks such as an oil price spike or disruption in supply chains, particularly in the context of accelerating de-globalisation, lead to sudden and sever increases in costs, affecting production and distribution channels and ultimately driving up prices for goods and services. Furthermore, geopolitical developments, such as a second Trump presidency, reignite tariff wars with China, broadly hurting sentiment, depressing global trade, and raising costs worldwide.
