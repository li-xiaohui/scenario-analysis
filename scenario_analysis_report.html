                <div class="citation-source">The US administration has made contrasting comments regarding whether reciprocal tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) will be fully resolved on July 9. Within the likely scenarios, the most plausible outcome is a pragmatic mix of tariff pauses for countries that are undertaking positively viewed negotiations, alongside tariff increases for those countries where the administration believes trade negotiations have stalled. [...] Many, if not most, trade negotiations will continue after July 9, with tariff pauses likely for most trading partners. Nonetheless, following Trump’s statements that he will not extend the July 9 deadline and plans on implementing higher tariffs after that date, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence believes countries or territories will likely fall into four categories: [...] Irrespective of what the US administration decides regarding the outcome of the IEEPA-related tariff decisions on July 9, there will likely be a range of other tariff-related events during the remainder of 2025.

The US will likely undertake tariff actions driven by specific policy demands, most recently shown by Canada rescinding its Digital Services Tax after Trump’s threat to end talks.</div>

### Key Takeaways

   President Donald Trump&#x27;s 90-day pause on the &quot;Liberation Day&quot; tariffs expires on July 9.

   When the deadline passes, the U.S. could re-impose &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariffs on numerous countries, which would be a major drag on the economy.</div>

Trump&#x27;s tariff pause is set to expire, threatening a trade war flare-up
=======================================================================

Duties on imports from dozens of countries would jump if the 90-day pause imposed in April expires July 9 as scheduled.

                <div class="citation-title">Trump&#x27;s &#x27;reciprocal&#x27; tariff pause is about to expire. Cue the confusion</div>
                <div class="citation-source">Leading up to July 9, Trump administration officials threatened to simply return to April tariff rates, or possibly even higher levies. They also floated the possibility of extending the pause for countries “negotiating in good faith,” without defining what that means or which it includes.

It’s not clear where Trump, who will get the ultimate say, stands. [...] The 90-day deadline President Donald Trump set for countries to make trade deals with the United States or risk substantially higher tariffs is just days away. What will happen after that’s reached at 12:01 a.m. ET on July 9 is anyone’s best guess.

The stakes could not be higher, with the entire global economy on notice. [...] “They’ll range in value from maybe 60% or 70% tariffs to 10% and 20% tariffs,” Trump said.

For many countries, such rates would deal an even bigger economic blow compared to the levels Trump announced in April. But countries may have the opportunity to still negotiate, given Trump said most new rates won’t take effect until August 1.

America’s evolving pain tolerance for higher tariffs

                <div class="citation-source">deals so far. As such, following the July 9 deadline, the administration could reimpose country-specific reciprocal tariffs on a substantial number of trading partners that have not yet reached a deal with the U.S. Reimposition of these tariffs could significantly increase costs to import goods into the U.S., disrupt supply chains and impact all sectors of the economy. [...] The Trump Administration announced a 90-day pause on nearly all of the country-specific reciprocal tariffs on April 9, 2025, reducing these tariffs to the 10 percent baseline while the U.S. and its trading partners negotiate new bilateral trade agreements. This pause on the country-specific reciprocal tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, after which these tariffs will go back into effect unless otherwise modified.</div>

What Happens After July 9?

The end of the pause could trigger renewed tariff hikes. Prepare for multiple scenarios:

Smart companies are building resilience now. That means flexible sourcing, strategic inventory buffers, and updated financial models. Programs like Foreign Trade Zones and bonded warehouses may also offer cost-saving relief.

Final Thought – Don’t Navigate This Alone [...] Ocean Freight: Trans-Pacific spot rates have dropped significantly—down 40% year-over-year. But this may be temporary. With continued uncertainty and the threat of labor strikes, contract rates could spike again in 2025.

Air Cargo: E-commerce now drives about 20% of airfreight—and rising tariffs are accelerating this trend. Expect rate hikes and congestion around key deadlines. Past tariff waves slowed air cargo growth, and a similar pattern could repeat post-pause. [...] 3. Move Inventory Fast   
Shippers are rushing to move goods before tariffs potentially return. Ocean freight is busy, and air cargo demand is rising. If you haven’t started accelerating critical shipments, don’t wait—transport capacity could tighten fast, driving up costs.</div>

 By [...] A90-day freezeon sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.

The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called &quot;Liberation Day,&quot; could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets. [...] Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.</div>
